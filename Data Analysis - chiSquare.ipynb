    "\t•\tChi-Squared Statistic: 42.33 Such a high value indicates a major difference between observed and expected frequencies, with almost no overlap due to randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tP-value: 7.71 × 10⁻¹¹ This p-value is extremely small (much less than 0.05), showing the association is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tDegrees of Freedom: 1 Correct for a 2×2 table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tExpected Frequencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tSmoker:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tNon-Smoker:\n",
    "\tThe observed frequencies for smokers () and non-smokers () are very different from what would be expected if there were no association.\n",
    "\n",
    "What it Means\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tThe data provides overwhelming evidence that smoking status is associated with disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tThe null hypothesis (no association) is strongly rejected.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t•\tThe difference observed is not due to chance, implying a real relationship in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever the chi-square statistic is large and the p-value is extremely small, it signals a strong and significant association between the categorical variables (here: smoking and disease presence). If you calculated Cramér’s V, it would be close to 1, confirming a strong effect."
